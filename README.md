# In-Class-Projects
This repository holds examples of projects done in my classes.

Maze: Generates a maze of specified size and then finds the end by using the breadth
first and depth first search algorithms.  If no path is available, the program will
output "No Path."

Graph and Shortest Path: Reads a file and generates a graph based on the the file data.
Two vertices are also given by the file and the goal of the program is to find the shortest
path between these vertices and output the path using the console and JavaFX.  The path is
found using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

Format Checker: Reads a file and determines if the equations given are well formed or not.

Packet Handler Simulation: Uses a linked list and threads to simulate packet handling between
three producers and one consumer.  Depending on the destination the message will be output to
the console; however, the packet information is sent to separate file regardless.

Into the Darkness: This is a text adventure game that was made as the final project for my game
programming class.  The file is a compressed Unity project folder for the demo of the game.
Currently there are two floors and one boss as well as a room that when entered, lets the player
win the game.  I may work on improving and finishing the game in my free time.
